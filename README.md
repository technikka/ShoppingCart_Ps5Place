# Shopping Cart (Ps5 Place)

An application built using React with the main focus to implement shopping cart functionality. Note that this is not a full feature e-commerce application, simply a demonstration of a shopping cart.


* Number of items in cart is displayed and dynamically changes with the amount of items in shopping cart.

* Success message shows when an item is added to the cart with quantity added. Success messages are removed when that product is selected again, or if the user views the cart.

* Strict verification on quantity added to the cart for items with order limits.

* When the quantity of an item in the cart changes either from the shop page or from within the cart, the cart's item count, and total cost for that product and its quantity changes.

* Can remove item from cart and state of cart updates.

Though a front-end router is implemented here, I didn't trouble myself with creating additional content outside the scope of this project due to time contraints.
